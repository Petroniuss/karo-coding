# Exercise for lab1

We'll be playing with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).
For most exercies I suggest looking at examples (link above) from matplotlib and playing with them to get what we want.

#### setup

Install necessary libraries

`pip3 install matplotlib`
`pip3 install numpy`

## Exercise 1

To get started your first task will be to do something very similar to what we've done but it'll be a bit more interactive.

Write a program that draws a cosine but the frequency (`cos(frequency * 2pi * t)`) of the consine wave should be a commandline argument to your program - feel free to read about passing arguments to program - for example [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm).


## Exercise 2

Let's now try something different. Your task will be to draw a chessboard using matplotlib. Search for examples that draw some grids and try a similar approach. Also you may need to use `for` loops. See [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) for example.

## Exercise 3

Since you already know how to draw a chessboard, create a program that takes an argument (`n`) and draws a grid `n x n`. 

On that grid color points that lie on diagonals as black (or whatever color you like) :)
