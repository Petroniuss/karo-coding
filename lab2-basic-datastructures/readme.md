# lab 2 - basic datastructures

We're going to talk about a couple of datastructures:
- Lists (`[]`),
- Dicts (Dictionaries, HashTables, HashMaps, `{}`),

We'll be interesteed in how they actually work under the hood, what operations we've got available.


## Exercise 1

Implement your own `List`, see [list.py](./list.py)
